\section{Class-D Amplifier}
A Class-D Amplifier, also known as \textit{digital-amplifier} is a very efficient design of a power amplifier most commonly used in audio applications. The main principal is based on a switching output stage (often constructed with \acrshort{mosfet}s) that is driven by a \acrfull{pwm} signal. The switching frequency is much higher than the bandwith of the amplified signal (typically one order of magnitude higher). The most common modulation scheme uses a saw-tooth shaped signal and a comparator to generate the \acrshort{pwm} signal.\\
The output signal then has to be low-pass filtered, in order to suppress the high switching noise. This usually done by using a second order \acrshort{lc}-Filter at the output. Class-D amplifiers benefit from a low component count and the very high efficiency of up to 90\% and above.

\section{Quadrature Amplitude Modulation}\label{2_QAM_sec:QAM}
\acrfull{qam} \cite{nat_skript} is a modulation scheme where an in-phase component $I(t)$ and a quadrature component $Q(t)$ are mixed with orthogonal carriers and then added together, as shown in Figure \ref{2_fig:qam_diagram}. 
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Block diagram \acrshort{qam}}
    \label{2_fig:qam_diagram}
\end{figure}

The output signal $f(t)$ can be calculated as 
\begin{equation}
    f(t) = I(t) \sin \left ( \omega_0 t\right ) + Q(t)\underbrace{\sin \left ( \omega_0 t + \frac{\pi}{2} \right)}_{\cos{(\omega_0 t)}}.
\end{equation}
Through the use of some trigonometric identities this can be simplified to 
\begin{equation}
    f(t) = \sqrt{I^2(t) + Q^2(t)} \sin{\left(\omega_0 t + \arctan{ \left ( \frac{Q(t)}{I(t)} \right )} \right )}.
\end{equation}
\section{Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Transducer}
\acrfull{put} emit sound by using the reciprocal piezoelectric effect \cite{air_coupled_ultraonic}. By applying an electric voltage to piezoelectric material it is deformed and therefore produces ultrasound. Electrically a \acrshort{put} is best described by using the Butterworth van Dyke model, which is shown in Figure \ref{2_fig:butt_dyke_model}.
The impedance response of this model is shown in Figure \ref{2_fig:impedance_put}.

\section{Diffraction from Slits}
The principle of Huygens-Fresnel \cite{physik_skript} states that every element on a wave surface can be viewed as a center of a spherical wave. Even if this is physically viewed not entirely correct, this provides a good model through which the wave changes in time can be calculated. This principle will be used to calculate the diffraction of waves on slits.

The calculations for the diffraction are only valid in the far-field. 
\subsection{Single-Slit Diffraction}\label{2_subsec:single_slit}
All the points inside of the slits are viewed, accordingly to the Huygens-Fresnel principle, as centers of spherical waves. 
If we now want to know the pressure of a wave of frequency $\omega$ at a certain point in space, with distance $r$ and angle $\phi$ to the slit, one can superposition all the points inside of the slit \cite{physik_skript}
\begin{equation}
    p(r, \phi, \omega)  
    = 
    \frac{A}{rs}\int_0^a \cos \left ( \omega t - k r + k x \sin\left ( \phi\right )\right) dx.
\end{equation}
Where $A$ is the amplitude of the wave at the slit, $a$ is the size of the slit and $k$ is the wave number given as
\begin{equation}
    k 
    = 
    \frac{\omega}{c}.
\end{equation}
This can be simplified to
\begin{equation}
     p(r, \phi, \omega) 
     = 
     \frac{A}{r}  \underbrace{\frac{\sin \left ( \frac{ka \sin \phi}{2}\right )}{ \frac{ka \sin \phi}{2}}}_{A_s(\phi,k,a)} \cos \left ( \omega t - k r\right ).
     \label{2_eq:single_slid_final}
\end{equation}
The function $A_s(\phi,\omega,a)$ shows how the amplitude of the wave varies according to the angle, the frequency and the size of the slit. 

In Figure \ref{2_subfig:single_slid_amp} it is shown how the amplitude over the angle changes with different frequency while the slit size is hold constant at $a = 0.016 \,$m for waves with the speed $343 \,$m/s (speed of sound at 22 degrees Celsius). Additionally, Figure \ref{2_subfig:single_slid_pow} shows the power.

\subsection{Diffraction on Slits \& Fourier Transform}\label{2_Acoustics_sec:diffraction_fourier}
The diffraction pattern of a sound wave, in the x-y plane, can be calculated using the Fourier transform, because of the similarities in the equations. If the frequency is assumed to be $f = \frac{k x}{2 \pi y}$ they are exactly the same. \cite{diffraction_fourier} 

For example in the case with one slit, which has a size of $s$ and and its middle is at the point $(0,0)$ and edges at $(0,\pm a/2)$ the \textit{Slit function} $s(x)$ would look like
\begin{equation}
     s(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{$|x| < \frac{a}{2}$}\\
      0 & \text{else}
     \end{cases}.
\end{equation}
The Fourier transform of this would be
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{F}\left \{ s(x) \right \} = A_s\left ( 2\pi\frac{f x}{c y} \right ) = a\frac{\sin{\left(  \frac{\pi f x a}{c y} \right )}}{\frac{\pi f x a}{c y}}. 
\end{equation}
Near the y axis this can be simplified to \cite{alma99116706330905515}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{x}{y} = \sin{(\varphi)}.
\end{equation}
This leads to the same formula for the amplitude as seen before in \ref{2_eq:single_slid_final}
\begin{equation}
    A_s(\phi, k, a) = \frac{\sin \left ( \frac{ka \sin \phi}{2}\right )}{ \frac{ka \sin \phi}{2}}.
\end{equation}
\subsection{Multiple Slits Diffraction}
With the Fourier transform idea, explained in Section \ref{2_Acoustics_sec:diffraction_fourier}, the amplitude and power of any multi-slit layout can now easily be calculated. 
For $M$ transducers, with the size $a$ and a spacing $d$ the pattern can be easily calculated to be
\begin{equation}
     A_s(\phi, k, a, d, M)
     =
     \frac{\sin \left ( \frac{ka \sin \phi}{2}\right )}{ \frac{ka \sin \phi}{2}} \frac{\sin^2\left( \frac{k d \sin{\varphi}}{2}M\right )}{\sin^2\left( \frac{k d \sin{\varphi}}{2}\right )}.
\end{equation}
In Figure \ref{6_fig:multiple_diffraction} examples for different transducer widths is shown.

\section{Acoustics}
\subsection{Basics}
A sound wave is a disturbance propagated through  a material (mostly air in acoustics) which causes a variation in pressure.
This disturbance in the ambient pressure is the sound pressure and is proportional to the inverse of the squared distance to the source \cite{BERANEK20121}
\begin{equation}\label{2_Acoustics_eq:Pressure_sphere}
    p(r) \propto \frac{1}{r^2}.
\end{equation}
To get a better feeling for sound pressure, in table \ref{2_Acoustics_tab:Sound_pressure_level} are some examples listed of different sound sources, distances and their approximate sound pressure. \cite{rossing1990science}
\begin{center}
\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |} 
     \hline 
     Sound source & Distance & Sound Pressure [Pa] & \acrshort{spl} [dB ref. $20 \, \mu$Pa] \\ 
     \hline
     Jet takeoff & 60$\,$m & 20 & 120 \\  
     Loud shouting & 1.5$\,$m & 2 & 100 \\
     Busy street & - & 0.2 & 80 \\
     Normal conversation & 1$\,$m & 0.02 & 60 \\
     Hearing threshold & - & 0.00002 & 0 \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Sound Sources and their respective Sound Pressure (Level)}
    \label{2_Acoustics_tab:Sound_pressure_level}
\end{table}
\end{center}
Additionally, the \acrfull{spl} $L_p$ is displayed. It is the logarithmic measure of sound pressure $p$ relative to a reference value $p_0$.
\begin{equation}
    L_p 
    =
    20 \log_{10} \left ( \frac{p}{p_0} \right ) [dB].
\end{equation}
Mostly this reference value is picked to be $20 \, \mu\text{Pa}$ which is the hearing threshold of humans. \cite{rossing1990science}
\subsection{Sound Power}
The sound power is the total sound energy emitted by a loudspeaker. Often instead of the sound power the sound power level is used. This sound power level $L_W$ is the logarithmic measure of sound power $P$ relative to a reference power $P_0$
\begin{equation}
    L_W = 10\log_{10} \left (  \frac{P}{P_0} \right ) [dB].
\end{equation}
The reference power is often chosen to be $1 \, \text{pW}$. \cite{rossing1990science}
\subsection{Directivity}
In this application, especially the directivity of a sound source is of high importance. 
The directivity of a sound source is quantified by its directivity factor $Q_D$. This factor is defined as \cite{DirectivityIndices}
\begin{equation}\label{2_Acoustics_eq:Directivity}
    Q_D = \frac{|p_{axis}|^2}{\rho_0 c}\frac{4 \pi r^2}{W} = \frac{4 \pi p_{rms}^2}{2\pi\int_0^{\pi}p^2_{rms}(\theta)\sin{\theta}d\theta}. 
\end{equation}
\subsection{Sound Power Level vs. Sound Pressure Level}
The sound pressure level at any point can be calculated through the distance to the source $r$, the sound power level of the source and the directivity. It is given, according to \cite{Relationship_Sound_pressure}, as
\begin{equation}\label{2_Acoustics_eq:SPLvSPL}
    L_p = L_W + 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{Q_D}{4 \pi r^2} + \frac{4}{R_c} \right ).
\end{equation}
Where $R_c$ is the room constant defined as
\begin{equation}
    R_c = \frac{S\alpha_{av}}{1 - \alpha_{av}} [m^3].
\end{equation}
Here $S$ stands for the volume  and $\alpha_{av}$ is the average absorption coefficient of the room.  If the room is large enough ($S >> 1$) then $R_c >> 1$ follows which means Equation \ref{2_Acoustics_eq:SPLvSPL} can be simplified to
\begin{equation}
     L_p 
     = 
     L_W + 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{Q_D}{4 \pi r^2} \right ) 
     =
     L_W + 10\left ( \log_{10}(Q_D) - \log_{10}(r^2) - \underbrace{\log_{10}(4\pi)}_{\approx 1.1 \, B}  \right ). 
\end{equation}
